## Resubmission
This is a resubmission in response to the previous feedbacks. We have made the following changes:
* Started the Description field with "Collapsed" rather than the name of the package or "This package"
* Corrected the spelling of "parametrisation" to "parameterisation". The word "Variational" might not exist in standard English dictionary, but it is meaningful and correct in terms statistics and Bayesian computation

## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In response to the previous feedback, we have made the following changes:

* Expanded the Description field to a one-paragraph overview of the package's functionality
* Added \value sections to the Rd files for the exported functions, as follows:
  - eBa0.Rd: Describes return as no return value, called for side effects.
  - elbo_fixed_diagonal.Rd: Describes return as no return value, called for side effects.
  - generate_log_prob.Rd: Describes return as no return value, called for side effects.
  - plot.CVIoutput.Rd: Describes return as a ggplot object representing visualisation
* In R/cvi_singlerun.R, replaced cat() with message().
